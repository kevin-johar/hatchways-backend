- Consists of 2Ô∏è‚É£ endpoints Ô∏è
  - A server status check `GET /api/ping` 
  - A flexible blog posts querying endpoint (filter by tags, sort data by different properties) `GET /api/posts?tags=?&sortBy=?&direction=?`

cd walnut-backend-assessment
```

###Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Start Application
```
npm run start
```

### Test Application
```
npm run test
```

## Technologies Used
- Node.JS + Express
- Jest Testing Framework
  - Jest-Extended, library of extra jest matcher functions
- Supertest library for testing endpoints
- Axios for making outgoing requests

##Fun Notes
- Application has caching mechanism to reduce response time by up to 75% üöÄ
  - Asynchronously the data is still updated, so you are never served super stale data ü§¢

##To Improve
- Caching using Redis as well as an external NoSQL DB to add redundancy to data
- Didn't' achieve full 100% test coverage, had to skip over some lines of code in the test environment to avoid errors (ex. api.js @ line 48)
